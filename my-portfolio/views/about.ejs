<%- include('partials/header', { title: 'About — Ayman Sohail' }) %>
<!-- I added this so the About page automatically pulls in my shared header partial.
     It includes Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and the site navigation.
     The title 'About — Ayman Sohail' gets passed dynamically to the <title> tag. -->

<!-- The header partial already opens <body> and the wrapper,
     so this file just focuses on the unique About content. -->

<article class="container my-5">
  <!-- Added Bootstrap .container for consistent page width,
       and .my-5 for top/bottom spacing to make the section breathe. -->

  <h2 class="text-center mb-4">About Me</h2>
  <!-- Centered the heading with .text-center and added margin below using .mb-4 -->

  <section class="text-center mb-5">
    <!-- Grouped my headshot and intro together.
         Added .text-center to center them and .mb-5 to create extra spacing below. -->

    <!-- Added Bootstrap .img-fluid to make the image responsive,
         .rounded-circle to make it circular,
         .shadow-sm for a soft drop shadow,
         and .mb-3 for spacing below the image.
         Also limited the max width so it doesn’t stretch too large. -->

      <!-- Using Bootstrap’s .lead for a slightly larger font that draws attention.
           .mx-auto centers the paragraph, and I capped the width for good readability. -->
